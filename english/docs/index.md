## SysEleven Stack Documentation

### First steps with little resource use - perfect for your trial

["First steps"](tutorials/01-firststeps.md) show, how you can start a compute instance via the dashboard of the SysEleven Stack.

Further examples show, how you can use the API of the SysEleven Stack to manage complex setups.

### Complex setups

On top of the first step examples, SysEleven provides a [library of basic templates](https://github.com/syseleven/heattemplates-examples) that will help you with the creation of a complex setup.

These setups are not written for the resources you have during your trial period.
